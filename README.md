# F4 Secure Cloud Declarative Onboarding
 
## Unclass STIG Example
* [Unclass STIG Baseline](https://github.com/Mikej81/f5-securecloud-DO/blob/master/source/U_STIG_Baseline.json) This covers a good portion of required configuration items for STIGS / SRGS tied to DODIN APL.

## NIST 800-53 Example
* [NIST 800-53 Baseline](https://github.com/Mikej81/f5-securecloud-DO/blob/master/source/NIST_800_53_Baseline.json)  This covers the currently supported items in DO for 800-53.  Remote Auth is supported but not included currently.  The goal is to have parity and take over for the NIST 800-53 iApp.  [Reference Deployment Guide](https://www.f5.com/services/resources/deployment-guides/nist-sp-800-53r4-compliance)
